# Notes App RealTime Server

This project is a Node.js backend for a real-time notes application, built with a structured MVC architecture using controllers, models, middlewares, and routes.1 It is designed to handle note operations and support real-time interactions, ensuring that users can create, update, and delete notes efficiently.1

### Features
RESTful API Endpoints: Provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes.1

Real-Time Updates: Designed to support live updates (integration with websockets or similar real-time technology can be added).1

Modular Architecture: Organized into controllers, middlewares, models, and routes for maintainability and scalability.1

Error Handling: Includes middleware for handling errors and validating incoming requests.1

Installation
To run the server on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/bajpaisushil/Notes_App_RealTime_Server.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd Notes_App_RealTime_Server
Install dependencies:


npm install
Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can start the server with one of the following commands:

Using npm start:


npm start
Or directly with Node:


node server.js
By default, the server will listen on the port defined in your environment variables or a default port (often 3000). You can now test the API endpoints using Postman, curl, or your browser by navigating to http://localhost:<PORT>.1

Project Structure
Below is an overview of the repositoryâ€™s structure to help you understand where each part of the project resides:

Folder/File	Description
controllers	Contains the business logic for note operations.
models	Defines the data schema and database interactions.
routes	Houses the API endpoint definitions for various note functionalities.
middlewares	Includes middleware functions for validation, authentication, etc.
server.js	Main file that initializes and starts the server.
Configuration
If your project requires custom environment settings, create a .env file in the root directory. For example:


PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
Adjust these variables as needed for your local setup.
